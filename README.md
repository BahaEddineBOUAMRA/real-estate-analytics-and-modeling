# Real Estate Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains two complementary projects centered around a comprehensive dataset of 70,000 real estate properties:

1. **Real Estate Rental Profitability Analysis (Data Analytics Project)**
2. **House Price Prediction with Machine Learning (Data Science Project)**

## Real Estate Rental Profitability Analysis

This project explores the dataset to identify key features that maximize rental income relative to purchase price and minimize years to profit.

### Highlights

- Created profitability-centric features such as annual net rent and years to profit.
- Analyzed distributions of price and net rent.
- Compared rental metrics across categorical features such as location, region type, property type, condition, and furnishing.
- Investigated numeric feature impact using correlation and scatter plots.
- Produced two detailed reports:
  - A technical report covering methodology, data processes, and findings.
  - A business-friendly report providing clear, actionable investment insights.

## House Price Prediction with Machine Learning (Data Science)

This project focuses on modeling house prices using various regression algorithms.

### Highlights

- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.
- Trained and evaluated models:
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Used 5-fold cross-validation and train-test split for performance evaluation.
- Generated detailed evaluation metrics including MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Produced visualizations of feature distributions and correlations.

## Usage

1. Explore the detailed reports in `/reports` to understand both analytics and modeling outcomes.
2. Run and modify notebooks in `/notebooks` to reproduce or extend the analyses and modeling.
3. Dataset is located in `/data` — update file paths in notebooks if needed.

## Key Insights

- Urban areas like San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles lead in rental profitability and house prices.
- Property features such as newer age, size (>1500 sqft), number of bedrooms (3+), and parking strongly influence rental returns and prices.
- Fully furnished properties in excellent condition yield higher investment returns.
- XGBoost outperforms Decision Trees in price prediction accuracy.
