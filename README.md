# Real Estate Rental Profitability Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of 70,000 real estate properties to identify key features that maximize rental income relative to purchase price and minimize years to profit.

## Project Highlights

- Created new profitability-centric features (annual net rent, years to profit).
- Analyzed price and net rent distributions.
- Compared rental metrics across key categorical features:
  - Location, Region Type, Property Type, Condition, Furnishing.
- Investigated numeric feature impact via correlation and scatter plots.
- Produced two detailed reports:
  - For technical audiences: methodology, data processes, and findings.
  - For real estate agents: clear, actionable investment insights.

## Repository Contents

- `/data`: Dataset file or data source information.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with reproducible analysis steps and charts.
- `/reports`: Detailed markdown reports for technical and business users.
- `/figures`: Visualization images from the analysis.
- `/src`: Python scripts for data processing and modeling (optional).

## Usage

1. Review reports in `/reports`.
2. Explore the analysis in `/notebooks`.
3. Extend or automate analysis with code from `/src`.

## Key Takeaways

- Urban locations like San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles dominate in rental profitability.
- Houses and Apartments, especially in new or excellent condition and fully furnished, show the highest returns.
- Larger properties (>1500 sqft, 3+ bedrooms, parking) significantly increase rental income.
- Investing in economically strong neighborhoods enhances rental stability and profitability.
